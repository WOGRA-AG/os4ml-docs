Our solution is trained quite fast and achieves an coefficient of determination of 0.82.

## Mnist
Mnist is the most famous dataset for image classification tasks.
It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, and the task is to classify each image into a digit.
[Here][mnist data] you can find an already prepared zip file to upload to our platform.
Create a solution by choosing the `label` column as the output column and wait until it is finished.

![mnist done]

After just 15 minutes of training, the solution is done and achieves an accuracy of 99%.
