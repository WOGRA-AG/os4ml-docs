# GPU support with k3d

[k3d][] says it's 'a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal 
Kubernetes distribution) in docker'. Well yes, they are right, and they are 
great. This is the reason why we use [k3d][] for our daily development work. 
For this reason it can be assumed that Os4ML runs stably on [k3d][].

It's quite nice to equip k3d with gpu support as described 
[here](https://k3d.io/v5.2.2/usage/advanced/cuda/).If you have problems 
building the Docker image, remember to install the 
`nvidia-container-toolkit` in addition to the `nvidia-container-runtime`.
