# Welcome to Open Space for Machine Learning
Open space for Machine Learning ([Os4ML][]) is an open source platform for 
automated machine learning. The goal is to enable non-experts to solve 
every day problems with AI. It automates all steps on the way to the 
finished AI model with the help of an intuitive UI/UX.

## About the Project
The project focuses on easy installation, intuitive UI/UX and comfortable 
machine learning.

We're not reinventing the wheel. Whenever possible, we use third-party open 
source software. For example, we rely on [Kubeflow][], especially for machine 
learning tasks. But don't worry, you don't need a running Kubeflow. 
[Kubeflow][] runs under the hood at Os4ML.

The project is in an early phase, i.e. everything is work in progress and 
experimental. We plan to release a first demo version at the end of March.
