Open space for Machine Learning ([Os4ML]) is an open source platform for 
automated machine learning. The goal is to enable non-experts to solve 
every day problems with AI. It automates all steps on the way to the 
finished AI model with the help of an intuitive UI/UX.

## About the Project
The project focuses on easy installation, intuitive UI/UX and comfortable 
machine learning. We're not reinventing the wheel. Whenever possible, we 
use third-party open source software.

The project is in an early phase, i.e. everything is work in progress and 
experimental. In the fall of 2022, we had an alpha release for a select 
group of users. Since then, we have stabilized the platform and have
opened it up to a wider range of users. You can request a demo [here][Os4ml demo].
