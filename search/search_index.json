The goal is to enable non-experts to solve every day problems with AI. It automates all steps on the way to the finished AI model with the help of an intuitive UI/UX. About the Project The project focuses on easy installation, intuitive UI/UX and comfortable machine learning. We're not reinventing the wheel. Whenever possible, we use third-party open source software. The project is in an early phase, i.e. everything is work in progress and experimental. In the fall of 2022, we had an alpha release for a select group of users. We are currently in the process of stabilizing the platform so that we can open it up to a wider range of users in spring 2023.

On the one hand it consists of a set of multiple python services using FastAPI and an Angular frontend. On the other hand it uses standard frameworks for common problems like Keycloak for authorization, Istio as ingress gateway, MinIO as high performance object storage and Kubeflow Pipelines as workflow engine. Thus, Os4ML benefits from the development performance of a strong open source community. This allows us to concentrate on high-level AI solutions.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#architecture","text":"Os4ML is designed as open source cloud-native application which runs on Kubernetes clusters.

It is illustrated in the following picture: Databag A databag is a convenient container for storing your data. You can easily create a databag by following the instructions in this tutorial , or explore the various file formats you can upload here . To manage the diversity of data types, we use the concept of multimodal data. Think of multimodal data as a table where each column is associated with a specific datatype, and the rows represent data corresponding to these columns. The petfinder dataset is an excellent example of multimodal data. For instance, it features Fenny, a dog(type 1) who is five years old and has been waiting for adoption for 100 days (AdoptionSpeed 4). The columns Type and AdoptionSpeed are categorical, the column Name contains text data, and Age is a numerical value. Additionally, the Image column contains image data. Problem Based on a databag, you can define a problem to be solved by specifying one or more output columns to be predicted. In the petfinder dataset example, you would typically want to predict the 'AdoptionSpeed' column. Here you can find more examples that illustrate how to model your machine learning problem using the multimodal approach. Solver A Solver is an abstraction of an AI algorithm that can solve a specific problem, by training an AI model on data from a Databag to predict the specified columns. To explore available solvers, check out this list . Solution When a solver is executed on a problem , it produces a solution that can be used to predict values for unseen data.
